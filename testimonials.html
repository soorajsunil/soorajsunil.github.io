         Hello
        Nice paper.
        Your "Historical Review on Piecewise Linear Approximation " is particularly deep.I did not know about Stone's work.
        I am surprised you dont method SWAB [a], which is probably the most used PLA algorithm in practice, at least a thousand papers use it.
        It seems like you are using linear interpolation [c], I (based on 25 years experience on hundreds of datasets) suggest you consider regression (it is more robust to noise).
        If you want to show off PLA, one cool idea is to do clustering, classification, motif discovery etc directly on the PLA representation. In [v] I show some examples...

          best wishes
