        <blockquote>
          "Sooraj demonstrated exceptional analytical skills during his research on Li-ion battery control systems. His ability to bridge theoretical concepts with practical application is impressive."

    <article class="testimonial">
        <blockquote>
          "Nice paper. Your 'Historical Review on Piecewise Linear Approximation' is particularly deep; I did not know about Stone's work. I suggest you consider regression [over linear interpolation] as it is more robust to noise. If you want to show off PLA, one cool idea is to do clustering, classification, motif discovery, etc., directly on the PLA representation."
